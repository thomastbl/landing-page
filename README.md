Hi, it's Thomas! 👋

Day 28 since I started learning web development, and I'm sharing my second project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com): building a landing page based on a [starter design](./model).
It’s a simple landing page, but it uses all the skills I’ve learned since the beginning of my journey.
Feel free to take a look at the project and the README while I prepare for the next step: JavaScript!

# 🌐 Landing Page — The Odin Project

A simple landing page, completed as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

This project focused heavily on **HTML** and **CSS Flexbox**, practicing responsive layouts, visual hierarchy, and modern design fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project allowed me to practice and solidify essential web development concepts.

### 🏗️ HTML Structure & Organization

* **Semantic Layout**: Use of clear tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **File Organization**: Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and image assets.
* **Naming Conventions**: Use of clear class names and nested wrappers for scalability.
* **Basic Responsiveness**: Implementation of the `meta viewport` for correct responsive rendering.

### 🎨 CSS Techniques & Flexbox

* **Flexbox Mastery**: Full use of the Flexbox model for alignment, spacing, and wrapping (`wrap`).
* **CSS Modularity**: Creation of reusable CSS classes (`.flex`, `.column`, `.wrapper`, etc.).
* **Visual Hierarchy**: Application of a strong visual hierarchy through typography, sizing, and color palettes.
* **Unified Design**: Consistent management of padding, margin, and borders using `box-sizing: border-box`.
* **Selectors and Specificity**: Logical organization of CSS selectors following the rules of the Cascade and Specificity.

### 🧩 Best Practices

* **Separation of Concerns**: HTML content distinct from CSS styling.
* **Version Control**: Use of incremental Git commits for each added feature.
* **Readability**: Consistent indentation and descriptive class naming.
* **Debugging**: Temporary use of visual aids (colored borders) for layout inspection.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool / Concept | Primary Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Semantic structure and page content |
| **CSS3 (Flexbox)** | Layout management and styling |
| **Google Fonts** | Custom typography integration ("Roboto") |
| **VSCode** | Development environment |
| **npx live-server** | Local server with Hot Reload |
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and project management |
| **Bash** | File navigation and quick workflow commands |

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

To ensure efficient construction, a simple yet productive workflow was implemented.

### 🔥 Live Preview & Hot Reload

I used `npx live-server` to run a local development server with automatic refresh.

### 🖥️ Multi-Screen Setup

Coding was done on a Mac (VSCode) while displaying the final render on a large PC monitor, accessible via the Mac's local IP address.

This optimized:
* Accurate visual feedback on large desktop screens.
* Adjustment of spacing, alignment, and Hero proportions.
* Verification of Flexbox behavior on wide screens.

### 🧩 Debugging and Layout Tools

Temporary CSS border utilities were used to visualize the boxes.

### 📱 Responsive Behavior Testing

Tests were performed using the Chrome DevTools mobile emulator (`Cmd + Shift + M`) and manual resizing, which allowed for the validation of:
* The effect of the `meta viewport` on mobile screens.
* How Flexbox automatically stacks or wraps elements.

---

## 💡 Design Overview

* **Header**: Logo and navigation links aligned via Flexbox.
* **Hero Section**: Balanced layout across two columns (text on the left, image on the right).
* **Illustration Section**: Four feature cards arranged with a Flexbox `wrap`.
* **Quote Section**: Centered content with large, contrasting typography.
* **CTA Section**: Highlighted block with strong visual contrast.
* **Footer**: Simple, centered layout.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps & Improvements

* Finalize **complete responsiveness** for phones and tablets.
* Add **hover animations** and CSS transitions.
* Improve the color palette and spacing for a more polished look.
* Experiment with **CSS Grid** to compare layout approaches.
